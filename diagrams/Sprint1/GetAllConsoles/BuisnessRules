New Business Rules
Consistency Rule:
The list of consoles fetched must reflect the most recent state of the database.

Pagination Rule (Optional):
If the list of consoles is too large, the system must implement pagination to limit the number of results returned.

Error Handling Rule:
If no consoles are available or an error occurs, the system must return an appropriate error response.

Business Requirements Derived
BR1: The system must fetch and return all consoles stored in the database in the most recent state.
BR2: The system must handle cases where no consoles are available by returning a proper response.
BR3: The system must provide consistent data in response, ensuring no outdated or incorrect information is returned.
System Requirements
SR1: Implement a query method (findAll) in the repository to fetch all consoles.
SR2: Include error handling in the service layer to handle empty datasets or query failures.
SR3: Optionally implement pagination support to handle large datasets efficiently.
