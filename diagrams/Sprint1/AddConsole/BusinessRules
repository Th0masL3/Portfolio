New Business Rules
Data Validation Rule:
All fields (e.g., name, release date, price, stock quantity, and company) in the ConsoleRequestModel must be validated for completeness and correctness before saving a new console. Invalid or incomplete data must be rejected with an appropriate error message.

Stock Initialization Rule:
When a new console is added, its stock quantity must be initialized to a non-negative value (defaulting to 0 if not provided).


Business Requirements Derived
BR1: The system must validate all fields in the console creation request for completeness, correctness, and uniqueness before saving the console.
BR2: The system must reject requests to add consoles if a console with the same consoleName and releaseDate already exists in the database.
BR3: The system must enforce that the quantityInStock is a non-negative number.


System Requirements
SR1: Implement server-side validation in the addConsole method to:
Reject empty or invalid fields for consoleName, releaseDate, price, and company.
Ensure quantityInStock is greater than or equal to 0.

SR2: Implement appropriate error handling in the addConsole method to:
Return a 400 Bad Request response if validation fails.

SR3: Add validation logic to the frontend (if applicable) to ensure all required fields are completed and meet basic validation criteria before submitting the form.
