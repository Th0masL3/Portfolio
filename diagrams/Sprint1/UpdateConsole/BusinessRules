New Business Rules

Update Integrity Rule:
Any update to a console's details must ensure all fields (e.g., name, release date, price, stock quantity, and company) are validated for completeness and correctness before saving.

Concurrency Rule:
Only one admin user can update the details of a specific console at any time to avoid conflicting changes.

Business Requirements Derived

BR1: The system must validate console details for completeness and correctness before committing updates.
BR2: The system must enforce a lock on a console when it is being updated to ensure no other admin can modify it simultaneously.

System Requirements
SR1: Implement field-level validation in the update form, including constraints for non-empty fields, valid dates, and positive numerical values for price and stock.
SR2: Add a locking mechanism in the database to prevent multiple updates on the same console concurrently
