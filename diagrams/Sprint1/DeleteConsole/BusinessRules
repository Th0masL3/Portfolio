Business Rules

BR-01: Only authorized users can delete a console from the system.
BR-02: A console can only be deleted if it exists in the system.
BR-03: When a console is deleted, all related data (e.g., inventory, orders referencing the console) must remain unaffected.
BR-04: If a console does not exist, the system must return a descriptive error message.


Business Requirements

BRQ-01: The system must verify the user's authorization level before allowing a console deletion request.
BRQ-02: The system must validate the console ID before attempting deletion.
BRQ-03: The system must perform a safe delete, ensuring no unintended data loss in related records.
BRQ-04: If the console ID does not exist, the system must return a 404 Not Found error with a clear message.

System Requirements

SR-01: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access the deleteConsoleById endpoint.
SR-02: Validate the console ID in the ConsoleService layer using findById.
SR-03: Ensure related tables (e.g., inventory, orders) are unaffected during console deletion.
SR-04: Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages:
204 No Content for successful deletion.
404 Not Found for non-existent console ID.


Note: The RBAC will be implemented during our second sprint with the authentication system.
